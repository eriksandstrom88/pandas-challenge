# pandas-challenge
Homework 04 for DU Data Analytics Bootcamp
This challenge required taking two .csv files—one with data on schools in a district, the other with data on students within the same district—and merging them together to create a district-wide file.  I used python/pandas to filter, group, and bin that data to be able to summarize and to identify certain trends.  Upon completion there are many observable trends, of which here are three:
1)	Charter schools in this district outperform normal district schools by a wide margin in both reading and math on average.
2)	There does seem to be some correlation between per-student spending and performance—students perform better when per-student spending is higher.  There also seems to be some correlation between school size and student performance—students in the largest schools perform the worst.  However, many of the charter schools have lower per student budgets than many of the district schools, yet they still outperform the district schools.  The charter schools do tend to be smaller.
3)	Throughout the district, reading scores tend to be higher than math scores.
